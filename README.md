**Branch**
> making a branch is like making an alternate reality with your codebase, where you can make changes in two different clones of the same world. Then when you combine the branches the changes are added into a new codebase that has all the changes from both clones. 

**Clone**
> using `git clone *.git` will make a copy of that repository into the working directory (unless a path is specified) .

**Commit**
> making a commit is like saying "this code is good, I want to save it". It will only be saved on the local device at this point.

**Fetch**
> get branches / tags from another repo and add it to the current repo.

**GIT**
> a very popular form of version control, that can save code incrementally and work on codebases in individual features.

**Github**
> A Website that hosts git remote repos for free and hosts websites for free. It can be used as a web based ui to git.  

**Merge**

[//]: # (> ~~When a mommy branch and a daddy branch really love each-other~~)
> The process of combining the changes of two branches .

**Merge Conflict**

[//]: # (> ~~When the daddy branch cheats on the mommy branch the night before the wedding~~)
> when the same part of code was edited by both branches, there needs to be manual intervention. 

**Push**
>uploading code to the remote repository. 

**Pull**
> update the codebase on your machine with the most up-to-date version on the remote 

**Remote**
> usually GitHub but sometimes a hosted repo on the web.

**Repository**
> Codebase that is stored by its changes in the hidden .git folder.
